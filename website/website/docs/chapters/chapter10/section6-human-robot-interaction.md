# Human-Robot Interaction

## Introduction

Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) encompasses the study and practice of designing, implementing, and evaluating robots that can interact effectively with humans in various contexts. This interdisciplinary field combines insights from robotics, computer science, psychology, sociology, and design to create robots that can understand, communicate with, and collaborate with humans naturally and safely. Successful HRI requires robots to interpret human behavior, express their own intentions clearly, and adapt their behavior to different users and contexts. The field addresses both technical challenges such as perception and natural interfaces, as well as social challenges such as trust, acceptance, and ethical considerations. As robots become more prevalent in homes, workplaces, and public spaces, HRI research plays a crucial role in ensuring that these systems enhance rather than hinder human activities.
